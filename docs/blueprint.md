## Core Features:

- Terminal Chat UI: Terminal-style interface for text-based chat, mimicking a command-line environment.
- P2P Connection: Direct peer-to-peer connection setup between two users via unique identifier.

- Command History: Command history to revisit past messages like terminal history, including search and navigation.
- Simple Authentication: Simple authentication based on pre-shared keys or a secure handshake, focusing on ease of setup.
- AI Love Tool: Use a LLM tool that monitors message content and subtly add an ASCII art version of an 'I love you' into the chat, when it deems it necessary to the conversation, making use of the full available set of ACSII symbols, or using one or another type of symbol in the whole 'illustration'.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid, saturated green (#00FF00) to emulate classic terminal text.
- Background color: Deep, dark gray (#1E1E1E) to recreate a terminal backdrop.
- Accent color: Light gray (#D4D4D4) for prompts, user input indicators, and other UI elements requiring subtle emphasis.
- Body and headline font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) to ensure consistent character width and a retro terminal feel.
- Full-screen terminal interface with a command-line prompt at the bottom for input.
- Message display emulates terminal output, appearing line by line above the prompt.
- A subtle cursor blinking effect to simulate a real terminal.
